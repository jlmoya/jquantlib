# Phase 2b — Execution Progress

**Last update:** 2026-04-25
**Tip commit:** `aa1a993` on `origin/main`
**Baseline test suite:** 628 tests, 24 skipped, 0 failures.
**Scanner:** 2 stubs (2 WIP — CapHelper + G2; both Phase-2c carveouts, unchanged from Phase 2a tip).

## Done

| Layer | Task | Commit | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| L0 | Pre-flight (baseline green, scanner snapshot, harness verified) | — (no commit) | 626/0/0/25 confirmed; scanner = 2 (CapHelper + G2). |
| L1 | WI-1 HestonProcess `QuadraticExponentialMartingale` | `d0de1e4` | 626 → 628 tests. QEM enum + martingale `k0` correction in both psi sub-branches; probe extended with 2 cases; 2 new Java tests. Spec-reviewed and code-quality-reviewed. |
| L1 chore | HestonProcessTest header refresh for QEM coverage | `29f4dbf` | Picked up the 3 minor doc-hygiene findings from L1 code review. Behavior unchanged. |
| L2 Task 2.2 | WI-2 Simplex 1D fix (test-side) | `f593de6` | Diagnosis A held: `Array.add(double)` is non-mutating. Fix: replace `new Array(0); initialValue.add(-100.0)` with `new Array(new double[] { -100.0 })` aligned to C++ `test-suite/optimizers.cpp:231-232`. OptimizerTest stays `@Ignore`d (un-skip is Task 2.3). Suite unchanged at 628/0/0/25. |
| L2 Task 2.3 | WI-2 un-skip `OptimizerTest` | `aa1a993` | `@Ignore` + carveout-pointer comment + unused `Ignore` import removed; `LevenbergMarquardt` uncommented in the active method matrix. Both Simplex and LM converge to x ≈ −0.5 inside `rootEpsilon=1e-8`. `phase2a-carveouts.md::WI-2-carveout-simplex` disposition updated. Skipped 25 → 24. WI-2 fully closed. |

## Next — L3 Task 3.1 (Vasicek + indirection pattern, A8 armed)

Replace Vasicek's `protected Parameter` member fields with package-private accessors that route every read through `arguments_.get(i)`; constructor populates `arguments_` directly via `set()`. Build the `vasicek_calibration_probe` (discountBondOption fingerprint at three (strike, maturity, bondMaturity) tuples), capture references, write the Java test, ensure tight-tier match.

A8 trigger armed: if the indirection breaks any previously-passing test, pause and ask the user (revise / carve-Vasicek / carve-family). The other three one-factor models (HullWhite, BlackKarasinski, CoxIngersollRoss) inherit the pattern in Tasks 3.2-3.4 — so getting 3.1's shape right matters across the family.

## Deviations from the plan to be aware of

1. **L0 Pre-flight done in-session, not via subagent.** The plan describes pre-flight as a `Task 0.1` checkbox sequence but it's verification-only with no commits — dispatching three subagents (implementer + spec reviewer + code quality reviewer) for "run scanner and check baseline tests" is ceremonial. Done directly by the controller; tasks marked complete in TodoWrite.
2. **Scanner stub IDs differ slightly from the plan's pre-flight expectation.** Plan expected `CapHelper#line23` and `G2#generateArguments`; actual scanner output (with the Phase-2a method-name heuristic improvements) names them `CapHelper#Period` and `G2#G2`. Same files, same lines — no material drift. Worth a follow-up sometime to tighten the heuristic for these two.
3. **L1 reviewer hygiene findings folded into a follow-on chore commit** rather than amended onto the original commit, per project rule (no `git commit --amend` for landed work).

## Remaining work (from `phase2b-plan.md`)

- L3 Task 3.1 — Vasicek + indirection pattern (A8 risk; next)
- L3 Task 3.2 — HullWhite indirection (A8 risk)
- L3 Task 3.3 — BlackKarasinski indirection (A8 risk)
- L3 Task 3.4 — CoxIngersollRoss indirection (A8 risk)
- L3 Task 3.5 — Update Vasicek carveout disposition
- L4 Task 4.1 — SABR investigation (A4 carve gate)
- L4 Task 4.2 OR 4.3 — SABR fix-or-carve outcome
- L5 Task 5.1 — `phase2b-completion.md`
- L5 Task 5.2 — Tag `jquantlib-phase2b-complete`

Pause-trigger A8 stays armed for the entire L3 sweep. A4 stays armed for the L4 SABR investigation.
